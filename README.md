# wound_localization
The wound dataset has been collected from the AZH Wound and Vascular Center, Milwaukee, WI, USA. This dataset (AZH Wound Database) contains a total of 1,010 wound images. Three types of ulcers have been included in the dataset: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), Pressure Ulcer (PU), and Venous Ulcer (VU). All the images are captured with iPad and DSLR cameras. No specific environmental or illumination condition has been applied during image capturing. These images are further processed and used as training and test data.
